## SwiftUI Application
### What is SwiftUI?

SwiftUI is a user interface toolkit offered by Apple that lets us design apps in a declarative way. That's a fancy way of saying that we tell SwiftUI how we want our UI to look and work, and it figures out how to make that happen as the user interacts with it.
